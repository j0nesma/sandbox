# Coding Challenges
Here I got inspired to use P5 https://p5js.org/ to start visualising and implementing coding practices. These will test my knowledge and improve my skill. Also it will give me a oppetunity to get to grips with many forms of algorithms.
# Algorithms 

## Bubble Sort Visualisation
This is a simple start, but it will visualise the way in which bubble sort, sorts numbers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort

## Binary Search Tree Visualisation

**There is a bug which i have "fixed" involving nodes overlapping in values which needs to be looked into....**

Implemented the Visualisation of binary search tree outcome 

[Visualising a binary search tree](./binaryTree/index.html)

**TO DO**
* Random Values
* Fix bug noted above more cleanly
* looping run which shows values being added to the tree and highlighting

## 2D Dimentional Island Generation
This was a investigation into noise, during uni i had one lesson on it and never had a chance to grasp what could be done. This is a simple implementation but was enlightening to me for how perlin noise provides great random numbers for land generation.

## Fractal Trees
Impleting the generation of a fractal tree, a tree created from recursion. This will cyle through a tree until a point then the tree will die of and restart. Some Nice to Haves (N2H)

**NICE TO HAVE**
- Implement configurable angles of the branches using p5 dom library
- Add animation to the leaves falling from the branch with nice physics and create 2 trees in its place

# Retro Games
I always wanted to recreate the simpler games, snake, minesweeper, pacman... the list goes on.

## Snake
Fun and simple game. Eat the fruit and the snake gets bigger. I loved it on my Nokia Brick.
