# Coding Challenges
Here I got inspired to use P5 https://p5js.org/ to start visualising and implementing coding practices. These will test my knowledge and improve my skill. Also it will give me a oppetunity to get to grips with many forms of algorithms.

## Bubble Sort
This is a simple start, but it will visualise the way in which bubble sort, sorts numbers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort

## 2D Dimentional Island Generation
This was a investigation into noise, during uni i had one lesson on it and never had a chance to grasp what could be done. This is a simple implementation but was enlightening to me for how perlin noise provides great random numbers for land generation.

## Retro Games
I always wanted to recreate the simpler games, snake, minesweeper, pacman... the list goes on.

### Snake
Fun and simple game. Eat the fruit and the snake gets bigger. I loved it on my Nokia Brick.
